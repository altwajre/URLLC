Link level evaluation with deployment scenario specific operating point and system level simulation are to be performed for the evaluations of Indoor Hotspot, Urban Macro, Highway, and Urban grid for connected car.
For URLLC, the target for user plane latency should be 0.5ms for UL, and 0.5ms for DL
The target for control plane latency should be 10ms.

From the analysis and simulation results we can see that contention based grant-free transmission with resource shared by multiple users is more efficient than the grant-based or traditional transmission, and it can well meet the reliability requirement of URLLC within the latency bound.

Taking advantage of Chernoff’s theorem [1], we can turn the violation probability
when the observed performance exceeds upper bounds into the MGFs of random processes as follows: where X is random variable, x is upper bound, is violation probability

To extend this work, we would further consider the  in highspeed moving communication in URLLC network. 

The influence of the violation probability is weak and can be omitted.

In this paper, we research the architecture of 5G URLLC network system.
According to the architecture feature, the network is modeled as a tandem system which demonstrate the communication from UE to Cloud.

we research on the feature in architecture of
